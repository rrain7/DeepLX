## Setup on [Bob App](https://bobtranslate.com/)

## Setup on [immersive-translate](https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate)
**It is not recommended, because the `immersive-translate` will send many requests in a short time, which will cause the `DeepL API` to block your IP.**

1. Install Latest [immersive-translate ](https://github.com/immersive-translate/immersive-translate/releases) on your browser.

2. Click on **Developer Settings** in the bottom left corner. **Enable Beta experimental features**.

3. Set the URL. (If you are not deploying locally, you need to change 127.0.0.1 to the IP of your server)
